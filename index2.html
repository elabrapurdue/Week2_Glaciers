        <h2>Why Are Glaciers Melting?</h2>
        <p> Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.

            Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the worldâ€™s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.
            
            Scientists project that if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice free in the summer as soon as the year 2040 as ocean and air temperatures continue to rise rapidly.

        <h2>What we can do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare for current impacts: Work on strategies to address climate change effects happening now.</li>
            <li>Focus on future reduction: Aim to lower heat-trapping gases to prevent further warming.</li>
            <li>Engage with local officials: Check if your city has a disaster response plan.</li>
            <li>Leverage nature: Use natural tools to protect communities.</li>
        </ul>
